This repo is an Ionic v3 starter app to show you how to add Twitter Log In to an Ionic App. There is also a detailed tutorial to help you with the Twitter setup and with the step by step of building this Ionic Framework app.

For this Ionic example app we are going to build a simple app that allows users to log in using their Twitter account. Once they log in, they will see a home page with their basic profile info.
